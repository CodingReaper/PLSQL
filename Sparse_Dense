In Oracle Essbase, dimensions are classified as sparse or dense based on how data is stored and accessed.

1. Dense Dimension
A dimension is considered dense if most of its possible data cells contain data.
Essbase stores dense data more compactly since most of its cells are filled.
Example: "Time" is often a dense dimension because every month (Jan, Feb, etc.) usually has data.
2. Sparse Dimension
A dimension is sparse when most of its possible data cells are empty.
Essbase does not store empty cells explicitly, which helps save space.
Example: "Products" or "Customers" are often sparse because not every product is sold in every region.
When to Use Sparse vs. Dense?
Use Sparse for Large, Scattered Data: If a dimension has a large number of members but only a few values per combination, making it sparse improves performance and saves storage.
Use Dense for Compact, Regular Data: If a dimension has values for most intersections, making it dense reduces fragmentation and speeds up calculations.

In Essbase, data storage is organized into two levels:

Index File â†’ Keeps track of where each data block is stored.
Data Block â†’ Stores the actual values of dense dimensions.
How It Works:
Each unique combination of sparse dimension members creates one data block.
The Essbase index file keeps track of where this block is stored.
That block then stores all values for the dense dimensions.
Example: Understanding Index to Data Block Mapping
Assume We Have:
âœ… Sparse Dimensions:

Product â†’ (A, B, C)
Region â†’ (East, West)
âœ… Dense Dimensions:
Time â†’ (Jan, Feb, Mar)
Measures â†’ (Revenue, Profit)

How This Helps Performance:
ðŸ”¹ Fewer data blocks = Faster retrieval (since all related dense data is stored together).
ðŸ”¹ No empty blocks (if a sparse combination has no data, no block is created, saving space).
