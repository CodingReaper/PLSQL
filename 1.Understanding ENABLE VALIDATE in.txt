1.Understanding ENABLE VALIDATE in Oracle
When creating or modifying constraints on a table, Oracle provides different states for constraint enforcement:

ENABLE → The constraint is enforced.
DISABLE → The constraint is not enforced.
VALIDATE → Oracle checks all existing rows to ensure they comply with the constraint.
NOVALIDATE → The constraint is enforced only for new data but does not check existing rows.

2.Yes! In Oracle, the DEFERRABLE and DEFERRED columns in USER_CONSTRAINTS represent the constraint state and behavior.

1. DEFERRABLE Column (Is the Constraint Deferrable?)
This column tells you whether the constraint can be deferred (i.e., whether it can be temporarily ignored until COMMIT).

DEFERRABLE Value	Meaning
DEFERRABLE	The constraint can be switched between IMMEDIATE and DEFERRED modes.
NOT DEFERRABLE	The constraint must be checked immediately after every statement (cannot be deferred).
2. DEFERRED Column (Is the Constraint Currently Deferred?)
This column tells you when the constraint is currently being enforced (either immediately or at commit).

DEFERRED Value	Meaning
IMMEDIATE	The constraint is being checked immediately after each statement.
DEFERRED	The constraint is being checked only at transaction commit.


Command to select the constraints:-select table_name,constraint_name,deferrable,deferred,validated,status from user_constraints where table_name='training';

3.SELECT COLUMN_NAME, TABLE_NAME
FROM USER_TAB_COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'EMPLOYEES';

SELECT INDEX_NAME, TABLE_NAME, TABLE_OWNER
FROM USER_INDEXES;

SELECT OBJECT_NAME, PROCEDURE_NAME
FROM USER_PROCEDURES;

4.SELECT CASE 
           WHEN NULL = NULL THEN 'True'
           ELSE 'False' 
       END AS result
FROM dual;

Because null represents lack of data 
and since it is unknown we cannot determine whether one null value is equal to another.

5.Oracle attempts to be helpful by implicitly converting the string ' 1' to a number.  It sees the digits '1' and interprets the string as the number 1. The leading space is ignored in the conversion process.
