If you want to add new records without deleting existing ones, use:

LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.txt'
APPEND INTO TABLE employees
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
(NAME, JOB, SAL INTEGER EXTERNAL, DEPTNO INTEGER EXTERNAL)

If you want to delete all existing rows before inserting new ones, use:

LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.txt'
TRUNCATE INTO TABLE employees
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
(NAME, JOB, SAL INTEGER EXTERNAL, DEPTNO INTEGER EXTERNAL)

If you want to delete only matching rows (based on primary key or unique key) and insert new data,

LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.txt'
REPLACE INTO TABLE employees
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
(NAME, JOB, SAL INTEGER EXTERNAL, DEPTNO INTEGER EXTERNAL)


--Only Those data i need
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.txt'
INSERT INTO TABLE employees
WHEN NAME = 'SCOTT'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
(
    NAME CHAR, 
    JOB CHAR, 
    SAL INTEGER EXTERNAL, 
    DEPTNO INTEGER EXTERNAL
)
