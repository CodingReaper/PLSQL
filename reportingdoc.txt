EPM Work Highlights
	•	Enhanced PCM ML shell script by adding functionality to archive existing dimension files, 
download the latest dimension files to the jumpbox, and move them to the PCM export directory for verification.
	•	Developed a Groovy script to automatically delete Level 0 dynamic calc members of the RC dimension during reorganizations, 
eliminating manual cleanup effort.
	•	Built two CPL reports for the PCM ML application to support business reporting requirements.
	•	Created a Python utility to perform single or multi-term searches across multiple Excel sheets, 
returning file names and row locations, and exporting results to CSV. 
This streamlined the process of identifying accounts and mappings during CPL report creation.
