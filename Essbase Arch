Essbase products incorporate powerful architectural features to handle a wide range of analytic
applications across large multiuser environments. Figure 1 provides a high-level view of the
information flow between the three tiers of the Essbase architecture. The client tier (on the left)
includes Essbase Server clients, such as Oracle Hyperion Smart View for Office and
Administration Services Console. The middle tier (in the center) includes services, such as Oracle
Hyperion Provider Services and Oracle Essbase Administration Services. The database tier (on
the right) is made up of Essbase Servers. Communication between the client and middle tiers,
and the middle and database tiers, is through HTTP. Communication between the client and
database tiers is through TCP/IP or HTTP. Communication between data sources and the
metadata catalog with the middle and database tiers is through ODBC and JDBC drivers.

In an Essbase architecture, an RDBMS source is used as the primary data origin for loading data into an Essbase cube, 
allowing users to leverage the detailed transactional data stored in a relational database for analysis within Essbase's multidimensional structure, 
which is optimized for fast aggregations and complex queries across large datasets; 
essentially, it acts as the "source of truth" for data that is then transformed and aggregated within the Essbase cube for business intelligence purposes. 

In Essbase, a metadata catalog acts as a central repository that stores all the structural information about an Essbase application, 
including dimension names, member properties, hierarchies, and security settings, 
allowing users to easily access and manage the metadata across different applications within an organization, 
essentially creating a single source of truth for data analysis and reporting.
